> rendered content of the donation site

We can input our name and a message as part of a 'donation', which kind of simulates a stream overlay:

![loading-dono](/img/pentest_on_stream_img/loading.png)
> some text input - we wait for the site to generate an image

![initial-output](/img/pentest_on_stream_img/loaded_init.png)

My initial thoughts are to test whether the site will dump our unsanitized HTML & Javascript input (especially given the challenge description).

Fortunately, it seems that we _can_ manipulate the HTML content of the remote DOM, but we are unable to get the server to pop an alert; noting the lack of any text content from the message field, it seems likely that there is something happening on the server that isn't rendered into the image:
![html-injection](/img/pentest_on_stream_img/html_injected.png)

![xss-alert-attempt](/img/pentest_on_stream_img/nothing_alert.png)

I want to see if I can get a script to render my injected content to confirm that the server is actually executing scripts in this message box - lets try rendering text into the DOM via a Javascript `document.getElementById()` function:

```html
<h2>uwu</h2>
<div id="uwu"></div>
<script>
    const uwu = document.getElementById("uwu")
    uwu.innerHTML = "owo"
</script>
```

## source code

Taking a quick look over the source code, it seems like the backend runs a Docker container running an OBS instance
connected via Python to the donation page front-end. Specifically, through the `obs_worker.py` module, we are
calling an HTML template `chat_base.html` and doing a direct string replacement and finally taking a screenshot
of the resulting rendered HTML in a  headless browser or something:

```python
import time
import obsws_python as obs
import redis
from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection

listen = ['default']

conn = redis.Redis()
obs_client = obs.ReqClient(host='localhost', port=4455, password='9WIBnsaL6t8Hiors')

with open("/app/chat_base.html", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    chat_html = f.read()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(conn):
        worker = Worker(list(map(Queue, listen)))
        worker.work()

def refresh_and_screenshot_chat(name, message, _):
    with open("/app/chat.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(chat_html.replace("__NAME__", name).replace("__MESSAGE__", message))
    obs_client.press_input_properties_button("Browser", "refreshnocache")
    # just dumbly wait for 1 second, there isn't a built in event we can hook to check for page load complete
    time.sleep(1)
    # cl.trigger_hot_key_by_name("OBSBasic.Screenshot")
    screenshot_b64 = obs_client.get_source_screenshot(name="chat", img_format="jpg", width=1280, height=720, quality=90)

    # reset
    with open("/app/chat.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(chat_html)
    # flip a property to force refresh
    rwa = obs_client.get_input_settings(name="Browser").input_settings["restart_when_active"] or False
    obs_client.set_input_settings(name="Browser", settings={"restart_when_active": not rwa}, overlay=True)

    return screenshot_b64.image_data
```
> I was thrown off a bit by the `Redis` instance here, but it is largely unimportant.

In the `scenes.json` file, we also see the flag resides as the name of a scene in the remote OBS instance:

```json
{
    "current_scene": "chat",
    "current_program_scene": "chat",
    "scene_order": [
        {
            "name": "chat"
        },
        {
            "name": "jellyCTF{redacted}"
        }
    ],
    "name": "scenes",

    // ....
```

Furthermore, we can do a Google search for python library used to interface with OBS, which returns
this [obsws_python](https://github.com/aatikturk/obsws-python) module, which is a Python wrapper for
[obs-websocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket) - an OBS websocket server builtin.

## flag

This API _appears_ to have a [standardised protocol](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/blob/master/docs/generated/protocol.md),
so I want to try seeing if I can perform some kind of Javascript injection to see if I can reach out to this
websocket from the HTML the Python worker inserts into the `chat_base.html` template.

Going through the aforementioned protocol documentation, we can find [a section on request API functions](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/blob/master/docs/generated/protocol.md#requests) with
a handy table of contents to show that we can [retrieve a list of scenes via a `GetSceneList` function](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/blob/master/docs/generated/protocol.md#getscenelist).
We can't call these via their Python bindings using Javascipt, but the API has a [set of Javascript bindings](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-browser/blob/master/README.md) that
might be available to us. We can construct the following script to call the `GetSceneList` via the API's Javascript binding:

```html
<div id="uwu"></div>
<script>
    const uwu = document.getElementById("uwu");
    uwu.innerHTML = "owo";
</script>
```

Calling this via the site prints our flag:
