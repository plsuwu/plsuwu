# Rock, Paper, Psychic

<aside>
üëª Wanna play a game of rock, paper, scissors against a computer that can read your mind? Sounds fun, right?
</aside>

We are presented with a `.7z` file containing an`.exe` binary. After extracting, I tried a few simple classics (buffer overflow/format string stuff) - though nothing wound up sticking.

Loading the binary into IDA, we are able to perform a quick search for the term `flag` and make a quick note of any functions or subroutines:

Interesting functions

Checking out our `printFlag` function, I‚Äôm not *entirely* sure what‚Äôs going on here (on account of the weird Nim machine code), but we can glean a bit of info regardless:

- The program seems to have been written in Nim,
- The binary uses this function when a player wins to load a memory address (represented by the variable `TM__V45tF8B8NBcxFcjfe7lhBw_38`, which contains a string) into `$rcx` before running a `copyString` function on it
    - This operation is run a second time, though on a different address (the string at `TM__V45tF8B8NBcxFcjfe7lhBw_39`).
- The `fromRC4` function seems to be the recipient of these strings - my assumption is that we‚Äôre deciphering RC4-encrypted text, which will probably hold our flag.

The addresses of `TM__V45tF8B8NBcxFcjfe7lhBw_38` & `TM__V45tF8B8NBcxFcjfe7lhBw_39` point to sequential sections in `.rdata`, and contain the following values respectively (note that each byte uses one `.rdata` address, so these were technically not represented like this in memory, though this is what we want to use for decryption):

Our values used in the decryption process use the strings `P P @gnnhexnyjkwpaghynzfthadollhtrhballsdmhhnbjppewgjkhnlhspwjswqoxtgdykxrhwlabblekxj` and `L L @D1E2A0D9FA89CABED207EDF4F55C688E04EBE20F077351BDAA1E110D5A74805C916AF12F054C` to decipher and print a flag.

Digging a little into the RC4 decryption function, we will find some child functions necessary to understand how we should ultimately be performing a decryption:

- `genKeystream__OOZOnimbleZpkgsZ8267524548O49O48Z826752_2`,
- `fromHex__OOZOnimbleZpkgsZ8267524548O49O48Z826752_83`.

`genKeystream` seems to just utilize a plaintext value, and it is fairly safe to assume `fromHex` will convert a string from its hex representation to ASCII. My other assumption was that `fromRC4` uses the string prefixed with `P P @` as the ‚Äúpassphrase‚Äù/key, and the hexadecimal string labeled `L L @` as its encrypted input.

With these assumptions, we can discard the weirdness at the start of our cipher strings, and we can run this through Cyberchef‚Äôs RC4 decrypt function to get our flag:
