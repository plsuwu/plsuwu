# Speakfriend

<aside>
It seems like this website was compromised. We found this file that seems to be related... can you make any sense of these and uncover a flag?
</aside>

We are handed a containerized webserver instance, and some required files in a zipped archive, `main.7z`. I suspect there is nothing surface-level to see on this web application's frontend - a
cursory glance through the source and various pages indicates that this assumption is *probably* correct.

Extracting the archive (via a quick `7z x main.7z` command), we can run some basic filetype identification commands - `file` / `strings` / `objdump`:

```bash
$ file main

Notable are the `curl` and `Mozilla` strings - the `H` strings might also refer to `curl`’s `-H` header argument - so it could be making some kind of request with `curl`, and pretending to be a Firefox client or something?

Lets just see what happens when we run the binary:

```bash
pls@RUBY~$ ./main

pls@RUBY~$
```

Nothing happened at all!!

We could try passing some arguments to it - I go with `-h`, to see if it has a `help` command/usage info. Something is happening in the background as `stdin` gets
hijacked, but ultimately I wound up aborting here with `<C-c>`.

![Untitled](/img/speakfriend_img/Untitled_1.webp)

Suspecting an internal call for some `curl` functionality - and therefore probably reaching out to the internet - we might get something on `Wireshark`:

![Untitled](/img/speakfriend_img/Untitled_2.webp)

It’s a little tough to say exactly what is what traffic is outbound from what application as nothing is immediately obvious here. Also, the challenge uses TLS, so it’s possible for basically any of
these to be relevant, as opposed to the bright green packets of unencrypted HTTP. Turning on hostnames was also pretty unhelpful - I really should set up a proper internalised lab with REMnux
to limit network traffic when I get the chance.

So instead, maybe we can give it a specific point to reach out to - why don’t we try running a specific IP through it? In fact, we can grab the IP of the remote machine with the Network tab
of Chrome’s Dev Tools and throw it in as an argument to see if the binary produces any network activity when we filter Wireshark results to contain only the target machine's IP:

![Untitled](/img/speakfriend_img/Untitled_3.webp)

```bash
pls@RUBY~$ ./main 34.123.197.237:32032
# ...
```

We can filter the Wireshark output for requests/responses containing that IP, and we see _exactly_ what we wanted to see.

It seems like the binary makes an unencrypted request to the server, meaning we can _also_ see the data attached to the request:

![Untitled](/img/speakfriend_img/Untitled_4.webp)

![Untitled](/img/speakfriend_img/Untitled_5.webp)

Let’s use those in our own curl request and see what happens:

```bash
pls@RUBY~$ curl 34.123.197.237:32032 -H 'GET / HTTP/1.1' \
-H 'Host: 34.123.197.237:32032' \
-H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 93bed45b-7b70-4097-9279-98a4aef0353e' \
-H 'Accept: */*'
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
```

Unlucky, maybe instead of an IP, we need to make a request to the URL itself (the server's SSL certificate is self-signed rather than CA-signed, so we need to tell `curl` that it should skip the certificate validity check using the `--insecure` arg):

```bash
curl https://chal.ctf.games:32032 --insecure -H 'GET / HTTP/1.1' \
-H 'Host: 34.123.197.237:32032' \
-H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 93bed45b-7b70-4097-9279-98a4aef0353e' \
-H 'Accept: */*'
<!doctype html>
<html lang=en>
<title>Redirecting...</title>
<h1>Redirecting...</h1>
<p>You should be redirected automatically to the target URL: <a href="/93bed45b-7b70-4097-9279-98a4aef0353e/c2">/93bed45b-7b70-4097-9279-98a4aef0353e/c2</a>. If not, click the link.
```

Add `-L` so `curl` will follow the redirect, and the server responds with the flag:

```sh
curl  https://chal.ctf.games:32032 --insecure -H 'GET / HTTP/1.1' \
-H 'Host: 34.123.197.237:32032' \
-H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 93bed45b-7b70-4097-9279-98a4aef0353e' \
-H 'Accept: */*' -L
flag{redacted}
```
