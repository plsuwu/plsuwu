# vlookup-hot-singles

This challenge was technically two separate challenges; I've condensed them into this single writeup because even though the first
challenge was stupid easy, I still kind of want to go over it for the sake of completionism.

looks like this is some kind of dating site for nerds? weird, figure out who the admin is and access their panel.
</aside>

Presented with a challenge URL ('[https://vlookup-hot-singles.jellyc.tf/](https://vlookup-hot-singles.jellyc.tf/)') and a zip archive containing the
site's source code, we are shown a little Bootstrap template chat webapp:

![site-initial](/img/vlookup_hot_singles_img/site_init.webp)

We know from the challenge description that we want to get to the `/admin` endpoint (a link to which is also the only interactive element on the page),
but we are forbade from accessing the endpoint without authentication:

![admin-endpoint](/img/vlookup_hot_singles_img/admin_endpoint_init.webp)

A quick look at the source code not only tells us that proof of identity is supplied to the server via a JWT cookie, but also the secret used to sign
the token alongside the credentials we will need to supply (`user: starknight` -> `user: jelly`):

![source-jwt-endpoint-function](/img/vlookup_hot_singles_img/source_code_token.webp)

We can now perform the painfully complicated task of dumping our `token` cookie into an [online JWT decoder like this one](https://token.dev/) so that we can
sign our modified token with the secret we saw in the server's source code (`singaQu5aeWoh1vuoJuD]ooJ9aeh2soh`):

![jwt-debug](/img/vlookup_hot_singles_img/jwt_decode.webp)

We can then replace our issued token with the modified one and navigate to the `/admin` endpoint without issue, grasping the first `vlookup-hot-singles` challenge flag:

oh. it's her. well, see if you can get the flag at /app/flag.txt and then get out of there

I instantly jumped to the idea of a potential XXE injection vulnerability in this function given the prompt to upload a spreadsheet.
I think that it's best if we quickly test out the response we should expect given an unmodified/known-good `xlsx` file, which we can procure by downloading
a blank spreadsheet from Google Docs. Gauging the server's response:

![openoffice-location-recorded-xlsx](/img/vlookup_hot_singles_img/test_upload_blank.webp)
> website output

... we can cross-reference this with the `/spreadsheet` route's source code:

```python
# ...

@app.route("/spreadsheet", methods=["POST"])
def spreadsheet():
    if not is_admin(request.cookies.get('token')):
        return "Unfromized"

    if "file" not in request.files:
        return redirect(url_for("admin"))

    file = request.files["file"]
    if file.filename == "":
        return redirect(url_for("admin"))

    if file:
        wb = load_workbook(filename=file)
        ws = wb.active
        ws.append(["Username", "Email", "Socials", "Real Name", "Age", "Height", "Country", "MBTI", "Job", "Income", "Relationship status", "Favorite Sanrio Character", "Favorite Minecraft Version"])
        resp_sheet = BytesIO()
        wb.save(resp_sheet)
        resp_sheet.seek(0)
        return send_file(
            resp_sheet,
            download_name="your_location_has_been_recorded.xlsx",
            as_attachment=True,
            mimetype="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"
            )

# ...
```
> the `xlsx` handler code


The file we just downloaded is an edited spreadsheet with some additional columns appended to the end. There are also a few base cases that return us to `/admin`
if we don't supply a file or the file's name is empty.

![burp-output](/img/vlookup_hot_singles_img/burpsuite_post.webp)
> the request in burpsuite, with the headers and data that Chrome automatically populates when we submit the form.

So my initial plan here seems reasonably straightfoward:
1. given that an `xlsx` is basically just a zip file, we inflate the spreadsheet to extract its internal XML files,
2. define a malcious entity and call it from an internal XML file that will be parsed by the server
3. re-compress the spreadsheet,
4. upload the spreadsheet, which will hopefully have the crafted content parsed by the `xlsx` parser
5. by parsing our entity, the server will write the content of the specified file back into the spreadsheet's internal XML,
6. maybe exfiltrate the flag in the returned `your_location_has_been_recorded.xlsx` sheet??

I initially opted for [this exotic `PayloadsAllTheThings` XXE payload](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XXE%20Injection#xxe-inside-xlsx-file),
as it met my requirements almost exactly. With slight modifications to directly specify the file to include, we avoid having to deal
with `ngrok` + local fileservers and the headache that comes with facilitating remote callbacks over the open internet (plus, we don't care to be reading multiple files, just `flag.txt`).
We know the flag filepath is `/app/flag.txt` given the challenge's description (though this information is also in the `Dockerfile` in the situation that we weren't explicitly given this info).

We can unzip a `spreadsheet.xlsx` into a new directory using `7zip`; I copy the blank Google Sheets document to a payload file and extract its contents to `./XXE/`, placing the
payload below into `workbook.xml` (the `PayloadsAllTheThings` description indicates that `xml` parsers often touch either `workbook.xml` or `sharedStrings.xml`).

```bash
cp Untitled\ spreadsheet.xlsx spreadsheet.xlsx
7z x -oXXE spreadsheet.xlsx
cd XXE
```
> duplicate the blank spreadsheet, extract it to a new directory, and move into that directory

```xml
<!-- inside `workbook.xml` -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<!DOCTYPE cdl [<!ELEMENT cdl ANY ><!ENTITY asd SYSTEM "file:///app/flag.txt"> ]>
<cdl>&asd;</cdl>
<workbook xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships">
```
> the payload we will try


We can then edit in our payload in a text editor of your choosing (I use Neovim btw), and then update the original `spreadsheet.xlsx` archive with `7zip`:

```bash
7z u ../spreadsheet.xlsx *
```

Uploading this spreadsheet, we get a promising (but still broken) response, maybe indicating that we're on the right track:

![resulting-response-p1](/img/vlookup_hot_singles_img/werkzeug_debug.webp)

When this didn't work as expected, I reset `workbook.xml` to its original state and tried a similar payload in `sharedStrings.xml`:
```xml
<!-- inside `sharedStrings.xml` -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<!DOCTYPE cdl [<!ELEMENT t ANY ><!ENTITY asd SYSTEM "file:///app/flag.txt"> ]>
<sst xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" count="10" uniqueCount="10"><si><t>&asd;</t></si><si><t>testA2</t></si></sst>
```

This gave us the same result - apparently our injected entity didn't exist >:((

I'll spare the details of what I tried here, but over the course of a few days I
- tried changing where the entity was called from,
- where the entity was defined,
- the original remote DTD exfiltration method,
- posting XML directly from burpsuite,
- several other methods that have been wiped from my memory, possibly as a trauma response,

... But I was continually gated by `lxml`'s XML parser despite these changes. I had an _inkling_ that this could be due to where I acquired the initial `.xlsx`
(i.e, Google Sheets vs. Microsoft Office) and the possible format differentials between the two, but I kind of decided that this _surely_ isn't the case, so
I tried to see if I could find my way into the debug mode console.

![debugger](/img/vlookup_hot_singles_img/shit.webp)

This was a rabbit hole that didn't yield a single meaningful result, so after a number of excruciating days and some rest, I turned to Google. According to [this report @ bugs.debian.org](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=854442),
the version of `openpyxl` (2.4.1) the server runs is definitely vulnerable external entity inclusion via the exact `file:///path/to/file` method we were trying,
but the MS Office `xlsx` format includes a `docProps` directory NOT present in the Google Sheets format.
The report seems to indicate that the `docProps/core.xml` file is pretty integral in getting `lxml` to actually parse our external entity:

![oh-mb](/img/vlookup_hot_singles_img/cve_payload.webp)

Modifying this sheet to grab the file at `/app/flag.txt` instead, we can update our spreadsheet's payload and then uploading this to the server.

And we download the `your_location_has_been_recorded.xlsx`. Incredible.

![downloaded-file](/img/vlookup_hot_singles_img/payload_result.webp)

We don't see a visible plaintext flag when we open the file normally, but this was kind of expected given where the entity is parsed. Extracting the spreadsheet and
opening `docProps/core.xml` again, we get our flag:
